# Fat Home Cat 

Fat Home Cat is a new web browser project; 

* Focused on improved **privacy** and **productivity**. 
* **Paid**, open source with free version for students.
* Including **encrypted e-mail** address for users (user@fathomecat.com)

See details below, including [Development Status](#development-status). Reach me out via azer@roadbeats.com if you're interested.

## No Tabbing Bar 🤯

You can open as many tabs you'd like and yet not see them.

## Private and 90s Modes 💾

It allows you apply some important preferences on any websites. These preferences are:

* **Private Mode:** Keeps the site data (cookies etc) in a private partition, so the site can't profile you.
* **90s Mode:** Turns off some milennium technology we can live without (e.g JavaScript) so you get true 90s experience on the selected website. Works really nice.

Check it out in the gifcast below:

# See it in action

I recorded this gifcast tonight. It's not exactly how Fat Home Cat look like at the end, but you get the idea.

# Development Status

An early proof of concept of this browser [is available in Github](https://github.com/kaktus/kaktus). I did not continue working on this prototype, realizing that I had to rewrite it. This repository is an attempt to check if there'd be enough support for making it real.
